# Duende Free and Open Source Software
This repository contains Duende's Free and Open Source Software. 

- [Duende.AccessTokenManagement](/access-token-management/) .NET libraries that manage
  OAuth and OpenId Connect access tokens.
- [Duende.IdentityModel](/identity-model/) IdentityModel is a .NET library for
  claims-based identity, OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.
- [Duende.IdentityModel.OidcClient](/identity-model-oidc-client/) Several libraries for
  building OpenID Connect (OIDC) native clients

## Relationship to IdentityModel
Several of the libraries within this repository used to be found in the
[IdentityModel](https://github.com/IdentityModel/IdentityModel) GitHub organization. Those
projects have been renamed with the prefix "Duende" to reflect that they are all
maintained by Duende Software and are designed to work well together. The name change
doesn't indicate other big changes: Duende Software is the company Brock and Dominick
founded, they remain involved in these libraries, and we are committed to keeping them
open source.
